# {{ site.serverName }}

Pinnacle SMP is a traditional, mostly vanilla Java Minecraft multiplayer server running version 1.18.1. Everyone is welcome to join as long as they're a member of the BitGardener discord server. We are currently not whitelisted at launch, but may add a whitelist depending on the active player count.

# What's different on this server?

 - Players can claim land to avoid being griefed or stolen from. (we want to stay true to the vanilla experience, but this feels like a necessary change to protect players)
 - There is a large shopping district set up at spawn so that players can create shops and sell their items.
 - The [Shopkeepers plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shopkeepers) allows players to make protected villager shops so that they can sell items without fear of being robbed.
 - There are three portals in the spawn tower that send the player to various points on the map (to enter the wilderness more quickly). Players must build 200 blocks outside of these portals.

 - Villager trading mechanics have been rebalanced.
    - _I made several changes to villager trades that may be controversial, but I've tested them thoroughly & I think they're what we need to have a healthy economy and avoid the shops being flooded with 1-diamond cost end-game gear and enchantments. Villagers are unfortunately a bit too strong on most vanilla survival servers & mean that players joining even a few days late will have a pretty big disadvantage. This helps prevent players getting extremely cheap max level gear overnight._
    - Raids and Zombified Villagers are disabled.
    - Villagers will only accept diamonds in exchange for emeralds, rewarding a high amount of villager experience, but still sell items like normal.
    - 8 emeralds can be crafted into 1 diamond and 1 diamond into 8 emeralds using a crafting table.
    - _These changes will make emeralds non-renewable and tie their value to the diamond standard._

# How does the shopping district work?

 - There are a large number of plots designated around spawn by leaf hedges. Each of these is a shopping district plot.
 - To claim one as your own, simply choose a plot and place your stuff there. Recommended: also claim this land to avoid griefing.
 - Only claim the land between the leaf walls, not the leaf walls themselves.
 - [Shopkeeper villagers](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shopkeepers) can be used to set prices for your items. They can be spawned via a villager spawn egg, which you can get from the second floor of the spawn tower.
 - Feel free to decorate your shop as much or as little as you would like! Make sure to advertise and the business will start rolling in.
